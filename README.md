# Activity tracker made by [Mark Varga](https://github.com/markvarga21)
## 1. Desired functionalities:
* The application will have a front page, which has a button, which redirects to the main page, where the user will be able to choose and list the activities added by him/her. 
* On the main page, when no activity is logged, there will be a button like panel, which displays a *Add new activity* text.
* If the user clicks on the *Add new activity* panel, he/her will be redirected to the activity adder window, where there will be a list of premade/preadded activites by the developer. 
* After selecting the desired activity, the application will prompt the user to enter the amount of the activity. After this, the program goes back to the main page, but now, with an added activity. The user might be able to view the calories burnt with the added activities when a new one is added.
* Finally, the user will be able to click a button on the bottom, which calculates and displays/sums up all the activities added beforehand.
